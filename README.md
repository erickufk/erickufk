## 

Experienced **Digital Product & Project Manager** 💻 with a strong focus on **AI** solutions 🧠. Passionate about leveraging **AI** to create innovative products and services that improve user experience 📈 and business efficiency 🚀. Skilled in leading cross-functional teams 👥, managing product development lifecycles 🗓️, and implementing successful solutions across various industries, including fintech 💰 and e-commerce 🛒. 

My interests lie in exploring the potential of **AI**, specifically **LLM models** 🤖, for automating processes ⚙️, generating content ✍️, and building intelligent chatbots 💬.
